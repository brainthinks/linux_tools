# My Personal Linux Tools

This is a monorepo containing the tools I often use in Linux.  I created this because, while my home folder persists, typically my Linux installations do not.  I wanted a way to keep all my notes and scripts easily accessible and modifiable so that as I switch computers or as things need to be updated, it is easy for me to get access to my tools.
